config CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_CAAM
	bool "Freescale CAAM-Multicore driver backend"
	depends on ARCH_IMX6
	help
	  Enables the driver module for Freescale's Cryptographic Accelerator
	  and Assurance Module (CAAM), also known as the SEC version 4 (SEC4).
	  This module creates job ring devices, and configures h/w
	  to operate as a DPAA component automatically, depending
	  on h/w feature availability.

	int "Job Ring size"

	range 2 9
	default "9"
	help
	  Select size of Job Rings as a power of 2, within the
	  range 2-9 (ring size 4-512).
	  Examples:
		2 => 4
		3 => 8
		4 => 16
		5 => 32
		6 => 64
		7 => 128
		8 => 256

	default y
	help
	  Some chips with HAB >= 4.2.3 have an incorrect implementation of the
	  RNG self-test in ROM code. In this case, a software self-test should
	  be run to ensure correctness of the RNG. By enabling this config
	  option, the software self-test is run automatically when this case
	  is detected.

	  Currently known impacted chips:
	  * i.MX6DQ+ silicon revision 1.1
	  * i.MX6DQ silicon revision 1.6
	  * i.MX6DLS silicon revision 1.4
	  * i.MX6SX silicon revision 1.4
	  * i.MX6UL silicon revision 1.2
	  * i.MX67SD silicon revision 1.3
